# vimeo-chapters
Js to make chapters in vimeo embedded videos. Links will skip the video to a specific time

video.html is an example: set id="myvideo" in video iframe and put a list of links with class="seek".
For each link set the time you want to start playing the video from, using attribute name.
Eg: name="60" will start the video at the first minute.
